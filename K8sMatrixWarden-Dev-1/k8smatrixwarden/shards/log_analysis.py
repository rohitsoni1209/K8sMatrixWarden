"""Shard ⑪ — Log Analysis & Audit Trail.

Answers one question the other ten shards do not: **if an attacker got in, could you
tell?** Every other shard asks whether a door is open; this one asks whether anyone is
writing down who walked through it.

That makes it the scan-surface counterpart to the Runtime Agent. The Runtime Agent
detects log tampering *as it happens* (`Container log cleared/truncated`, `K8s events
deleted` — MITRE T1070). This shard detects, at scan time, the posture that makes such
tampering unrecoverable in the first place: no audit policy, retention too short to cover
a dwell time, or no log collector shipping anything off the node. A cleared log only
matters if it was the only copy.

Scope note — the API server's `--audit-log-path` check already lives in
`cluster_control_plane` as `apiserver-audit-logging` (CIS 1.2.17). It is intentionally
left there rather than moved: rule ids are the identity used by saved reports and the
finding timeline, so renaming one would orphan history. This shard covers what that check
does *not* — the policy, the retention window, and whether logs leave the node at all.

Every rule here is scoped to the `log_analysis` module, so `--module log_analysis` (CLI),
`module:log_analysis` (dashboard selector) and the `log_analysis` MCP selector all
resolve to exactly this set.

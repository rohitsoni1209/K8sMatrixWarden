"""
Evidence Collector (§6.1).

The ONLY component that touches the cluster. It fetches the union of the resolved rules'
evidence needs, ONCE, constrained to the scan scope, and hands rules a shared, cached,
read-only snapshot. This is the efficiency win over per-tactic agents (redesign §3/§4).

Two backends:
  * MockEvidenceCollector  — loads a JSON fixture (default; zero dependencies).
  * LiveEvidenceCollector  — reads the K8s API as raw camelCase JSON (matches the fixture
                             exactly) via the optional `kubernetes` client.

`Evidence` is the object passed to every rule. Fields are accessed with dotted paths so
rule code is identical in mock and live mode.

"""
Finding Context — the single source of "report-grade" content for a finding.

Every professional scanner report (Nessus, Qualys, Prisma Cloud, Trivy...) presents a
finding as more than a one-line message: a plain-English summary, which named standard or
benchmark it's drawn from (with a reference link), the MITRE ATT&CK mapping (with a
reference link), the real-world impact if left unaddressed, the exact remediation, and
how to independently verify/reproduce it. This module is where all of that content is
authored ONCE and shared by every report renderer (markdown, html, json, sarif, pdf,
terminal) — so no format can drift from another about what a finding means or how to fix
it.

`FINDING_CONTEXT` holds hand-written summary/impact/validation content for every rule in
the registry (56, at the time of writing). A rule that somehow isn't in the KB yet (e.g. a
newly added one) still gets a sensible, non-empty fallback generated from its own tags —
never a blank section in a report.

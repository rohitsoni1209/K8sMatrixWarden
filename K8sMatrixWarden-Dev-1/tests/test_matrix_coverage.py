"""Threat-matrix coverage semantics.

Two things made the matrix understate real coverage, both fixed here:

  1. **Id-first cell matching.** The Redguard matrix is finer-grained than
     ATT&CK-for-Containers — "Access the K8s API server", "Access Kubelet API" and
     "Access Kubernetes dashboard" are three distinct Discovery techniques all carrying
     the single id T1613. Matching by id first collapsed them into one cell, so two
     rendered as coverage gaps even though rules for them existed.
  2. **The coverage layer ignored the Runtime Agent.** Techniques that are structurally
     invisible to a config snapshot (a shell being spawned, a miner starting) can only be
     covered at runtime, and were painted as flat gaps.

## What it does in 90 seconds

1. **Scan** — 60 detection rules across 11 security domains (cluster control plane, RBAC, network, secrets, admission control, supply chain, compliance, etc.)
2. **Correlate** — joins static findings to live Falco/audit runtime events by MITRE tactic + namespace → shows which weaknesses are **actively exploited**
3. **Visualize** — interactive dashboard with threat matrix heatmap, kill-chain exploit path, attack map (chain + vulnerable resources), MTTD/MTTR timeline, runtime readiness
4. **Report** — PDF/JSON/Markdown/SARIF exports with embedded attack path, CIS Benchmark v1.8 (130 controls), MITRE ATT&CK for Containers, OWASP K8s Top 10 mapping

**30 MCP tools** (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code Agent mode) — conversational API for scanning, correlation, RBAC generation, threat matrix building.

**Zero dependencies** in the core engine — pure Python stdlib, no database, runs offline.

---

## Why this matters

| Tool | Finds weaknesses | Shows runtime behavior | Correlates both | Attack path |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| **Trivy** | ✅ CVEs in images | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **kubescape** | ✅ Config misconfigs | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Falco** | ❌ | ✅ Syscalls & audit | ❌ | ❌ |
| **kube-bench** | ✅ CIS controls | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **K8sMatrixWarden** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **Confirmed exploitation** | ✅ Kill-chain |

**The gap:** Trivy catches that a Pod can run privileged. Falco sees a privileged-only syscall. Nobody connects them — until now.
**This tool:** "Found 358 static weaknesses. Of those, 4 are being exploited **right now**. Here's how the attacker chains them."

## Live demo (Kubernetes Goat)

```bash
# Scan live Kubernetes Goat (no setup needed, runs on minikube)
pip install -e ".[live]"
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --live --context minikube --save

# Open dashboard
python -m k8smatrixwarden web --port 8080
# → http://127.0.0.1:8080
# → Overview tab: 9.8/10 risk, 358 findings, 4 confirmed exploited
# → Attack Path tab: full kill-chain (Initial Access → Impact)
# → Attack Map tab: chain WITH vulnerable Pods/Deployments at each stage
# → Runtime tab: load sample Falco events → see correlation in action
```

**Result on Kubernetes Goat:**
- 358 findings (35 CRITICAL, 166 HIGH)
- 4 findings **confirmed** being actively exploited by sample Falco events
- Full kill-chain visible (9 tactics, reaches Impact)
- 77.8% scan coverage + 85.2% including runtime detections

## Requirements

**Python 3.10 – 3.14.** Nothing else — the core engine imports only the standard library, so
there is no dependency that can lag a new Python release. The 3.10 floor comes from the optional
extras (`mcp`, `kubernetes` and `fpdf2` each require 3.10+), not from the engine.

Verified on 3.11 and 3.14 (270/270 tests on both). **3.11 or 3.12 is the safest choice** for a
real deployment — every extra has shipped wheels for them for years.

If you have more than one Python installed, note that MCP clients launch whichever one `python`
resolves to. See [Troubleshooting](K8sMatrixWarden-doc.html#troubleshooting) if tools don't appear.

## Prerequisites

Only for scanning a **real cluster** — `--mock` needs none of this and is the default:

- A valid `kubeconfig` for the target cluster
- Read-only access to the target Kubernetes cluster
- Cloud CLI configured (AWS, Azure, GCP) for managed Kubernetes clusters.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. With an MCP client (the intended way)

The repository ships the config files for every MCP client that supports project-local
discovery, so there is nothing to write and no path to fill in.

| Client | File it reads | Ships in this repo? |
|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/mcp.json` | ✅ |
| **Claude Code** (CLI, desktop app, VS Code / JetBrains extensions) | `.mcp.json` | ✅ |
| **VS Code** — Copilot Chat, *Agent* mode (1.102+) | `.vscode/mcp.json` | ✅ |

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> && cd K8sMatrixWarden
   ```
2. **Open the folder** in your MCP client — Cursor, Claude Code, or VS Code.
3. **Enable the server and confirm the tools load.**
   - *Cursor* — **Settings → Tools & MCP**; `k8smatrixwarden` should be listed, toggled on, with
     30 tools under it.
   - *Claude Code* — run `/mcp`, approve the project-scoped server the first time it prompts.
   - *VS Code* — open Copilot Chat, switch the mode dropdown to **Agent**, then check the tools (🛠)
     picker. MCP tools only appear in Agent mode.
4. **Open the agent chat.**
5. **Start running the tool conversationally** — describe what you want; the agent picks the tools.

**Mock scan prompt** (no cluster needed):

> Run an `intelligent_scan` for privilege escalation on the mock cluster and summarize the
> findings, and also start the web interface.

**Live scan prompt:**

> Use k8smatrixwarden and run a live scan of my cluster covering the whole attack matrix.
> kubeconfig `"C:\Users\me\.kube\config"`, name it `"Prod live Scan"`, and give me a markdown
> report. Also start the web interface.

Scans run over MCP save to the shared report store by default, so anything the agent scans appears
immediately in the web dashboard's **Scan history**.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop and Windsurf</strong> — one paste, once</summary>

These read a single machine-wide config rather than a project file, so no repo file can reach
them. Install once — an **editable** install puts the package on `sys.path` permanently, so the
server starts no matter which directory the client spawns it in:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mcp]"     # from the repo root
```

Then add to that client's config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "k8smatrixwarden": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "k8smatrixwarden", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> The `k8smatrixwarden mcp` console script works too, but is more fragile — `pip` installs that
> launcher into a per-interpreter `Scripts/` (Windows) or `bin/` directory that is **often not on
> `PATH`**, and with several Pythons installed you get one launcher each with no control over which
> wins. `python -m` avoids both problems.

| Client | Config file |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop (Windows) | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` — or *Settings → Developer → Edit Config* |
| Claude Desktop (macOS) | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

Restart the client after editing.
</details>

> **Why not one file for all clients?** MCP standardizes the *protocol*, not *config discovery* —
> each client picked its own filename, directory and JSON shape (VS Code nests under `servers`
> with `"type": "stdio"`; everyone else uses `mcpServers`). The **server** never forks: all five
> clients run the identical `k8smatrixwarden mcp` process and see the identical 30 tools.

Verify the server independently at any time:

```bash
python -m k8smatrixwarden mcp --list-tools     # prints all 30, without starting the server
```

### 2. From the command line

The **core needs nothing** — it runs on the Python standard library alone against a bundled,
deliberately-insecure mock cluster.

```bash
python -m k8smatrixwarden doctor        # sanity-check the install
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --mock   # full scan, zero dependencies
```

Optional extras unlock live scanning / prettier output / MCP / PDF export:

```bash
pip install -e .              # installs the `k8smatrixwarden` command
pip install -e ".[live]"      # + kubernetes client for real clusters
pip install -e ".[pretty]"    # + rich terminal tables
pip install -e ".[mcp]"       # + MCP protocol server
pip install -e ".[pdf]"       # + fpdf2, for `-o pdf` report export
pip install -e ".[all]"       # everything
```

## TL;DR

```bash
# no install, no dependencies — runs against a bundled insecure mock cluster
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --mock

# name a scan — the saved report is "<name> + date + time" in the dashboard history
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --mock --name "Prod nightly"

# scan by MITRE tactic  (resolves across shards through ONE registry index)
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --tactic Persistence --mock

# scan by technique / outcome alias
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --technique "Container Escape" --mock

# natural language (one-shot)
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan "scan production for Persistence" --mock

# interactive chat assistant (back-and-forth, confirm-then-run)
python -m k8smatrixwarden chat

# see what a request resolves to WITHOUT scanning
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --module rbac_identity --dry-run
```

## Why this design

The whole tool turns on one idea: **domain shards are the execution boundary (vertical), MITRE
tactics are cross-cutting tags (horizontal), and they are orthogonal.** A rule like `hostPath
mount` lives in **one** shard but is tagged with three tactics (Persistence + Privilege Escalation
+ Lateral Movement). Every scan — by resource, tactic, technique, module, rule, alias, or
compliance framework — resolves through a single registry index to a set of `rule_id`s, then runs
against **one shared evidence fetch**.

```
Orchestrator (intent→scope→selector) → Registry.resolve(selector) → rule_id set
   → Evidence Collector (fetch once, scope-constrained) → Detection Engine (parallel)
   → Aggregator (dedupe+merge tags) → Risk Scoring (attack-path aware) → Reporting
```

## Core differentiators

- **Scan × runtime correlation** — joins static findings to live Falco/audit events by MITRE tactic: `confirmed` (actively exploited), `corroborated` (behavior aligns), `runtime-only` (new behavior)
- **Drift detection** — flags runtime behavior contradicting declared posture (uid 0 despite `runAsNonRoot`, writes despite `readOnlyRootFilesystem`)
- **Attack-path derivation** — chains threat matrix into kill-chain (Initial Access → Impact) with entry points and impact reachability
- **7-tab SPA dashboard** — Overview (KPIs), Findings (search/filter/sort), Threat Matrix (heatmap), Attack Path, Attack Map (chain + resources), Runtime, Scan history
- **Coverage accounting** — 77.8% scan + 85.2% including runtime detections (techniques only visible live are not counted as gaps)
- **Honest evidence reporting** — fails with real credential errors, never silently collects nothing
- **Safe by default** — dashboard binds `127.0.0.1`, kubeconfig auth is sandbox-isolated

## Commands

### Scan options

```
scope    : --namespace/-n · --pod · --workload KIND/name · --node · --image · --helm-release
selector : --tactic · --technique · --module · --rule · --alias · --framework · --severity-min
mode     : --mock (default) · --live · --fixture PATH · --kubeconfig PATH · --context NAME
output   : -o {terminal,text,markdown,json,sarif,html,pdf} · --output-file PATH
naming   : --name "<scan name>"     report is named "<name> + date + time"
store    : (saved by default → web dashboard) · --no-save to skip · --reports-dir PATH
flow     : --dry-run · --yes · --fail-on {LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL}   (CI mode)
```

> **Scans are saved by default.** Every `scan` (and every MCP `run_scan`/`intelligent_scan`)
> persists to the shared report store, so it shows up immediately in the web dashboard's
> **Scan history** — no `--save` needed. Use `--no-save` for a throwaway run.

Examples:

```bash
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan -n production --tactic "Credential Access" -o markdown --mock
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --framework CIS -o json --mock
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --technique "Exposed Secrets" --mock
python -m k8smatrixwarden scan --live --fail-on CRITICAL -o sarif --output-file results.sarif
```

### Full CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.8 (all 130 controls)

```bash
python -m k8smatrixwarden cis --mock                          # 130 controls, dashboard + failures
python -m k8smatrixwarden cis --kube-bench-json kb.json       # resolve the 31 node file controls
python -m k8smatrixwarden cis --mock --profile eks            # managed: control plane → NA
```

Every control gets a status — `PASS` / `FAIL` / `MANUAL` / `NA` / `NEEDS_NODE` — so nothing
is missed. **65 of 130 controls are evaluated straight from the K8s API** (25 native rules +
2 builtin + 38 control-plane/kubelet **process-flag** checks recovered from static-pod specs),
only **31** true file-permission controls need kube-bench (`--kube-bench-json`), and 34 are
CIS-designated manual reviews (surfaced, never auto-passed).

## The 11 domain shards

`① cluster_control_plane · ② workload_pod_security · ③ rbac_identity · ④ network_security ·
⑤ image_supply_chain · ⑥ secrets · ⑦ compliance · ⑧ attack_surface · ⑨ admission_control ·
⑩ cloud_iam · ⑪ log_analysis`

⑪ **log_analysis** answers the question the other ten don't: *if an attacker got in, could
you tell?* The others ask whether a door is open; this one asks whether anyone is writing
down who walked through it — audit policy, retention, log rotation, and whether any
collector ships logs off-node at all.

## Extending

Add a new scanner shard: drop a module in `k8smatrixwarden/shards/` exposing `SHARD = YourShard`
(subclass `DomainShard`, implement `rules()`). The Plugin Loader auto-discovers it, the
Mapping Engine auto-indexes its rules' tags, and a scoped RBAC role is generated from its
declared resource needs. **No engine change.** New MITRE technique? Add its id to
`taxonomy/attack_for_containers.json` and tag rules with it. New framework? Add a `cis:` /
`nsa_cisa:` / `owasp:` tag.

## Tests

```bash
python -m tests.run_tests          # bundled stdlib runner (no pytest needed)
python -m pytest tests/            # also works if pytest is installed
```

## Safety

**Detect-and-report only.** This tool never mutates the cluster from any surface — it has
no remediation/apply path. Scanning reads the cluster (get/list/watch only), and every
output (reports, threat matrix, MCP tools, web dashboard) is derived from that read-only
snapshot. The MCP surface exposes no write-capable tool, enforced by
`tests/test_mcp.py::test_no_remediation_or_apply_tool_is_exposed`.

Before scanning anything you care about, generate and apply the tool's own least-privilege RBAC —
one scoped `ClusterRole` per shard, every verb `get`/`list`/`watch`:

```bash
k8smatrixwarden roles --bind --output-file k8smatrixwarden-rbac.json
kubectl apply -f k8smatrixwarden-rbac.json
```

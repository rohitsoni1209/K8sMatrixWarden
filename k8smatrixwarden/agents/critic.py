"""
Evidence critic (Phase 4 + Upgrade 1/3). One LLM call reviewing the draft assessment.

Returns a richer verdict — approved, confidence, missing_evidence, recommended_tools, reason —
plus the original Phase-4 aliases (issues, recommended_actions) so older callers keep working.

Two hard rules baked in here:
  * Fail-open: any parse/format/API problem returns approved=True — a flaky critic can only ADD
    scrutiny, never block the REPL or drop an answer.
  * Low confidence never approves: confidence < 0.5 forces approved=False (Upgrade 3), so a
    self-assured-but-shaky verdict still triggers another evidence round.

1. Are findings supported by evidence from the tool results?
2. Were important validation steps skipped (runtime correlation, attack-path, drift)?
3. Is the severity justified, and is confidence in the finding warranted?
4. Are the recommendations accurate?
If evidence is insufficient, do NOT approve: list the gaps in "missing_evidence" and name the
tools that would close them in "recommended_tools". Respond with ONLY JSON:

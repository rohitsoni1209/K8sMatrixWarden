"""
Tool-result quality heuristic (Phase 5). No LLM — cheap structural checks.

Scores 0..1 and names missing information, so the orchestrator (and future tool selection) can
tell a rich result from a thin one. Persist via Memory.save_tool_quality.

ponytail: keyword-presence heuristic, not semantic. Upgrade to an LLM grader only if it
measurably mis-scores.

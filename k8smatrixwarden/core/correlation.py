"""
Scan × Runtime correlation (§8) — the "is this static weakness being exploited RIGHT NOW"
layer that no plain scanner has.

A Scanner finding says "this config is weak" (point-in-time). A Runtime alert says "this
behaviour just happened" (live stream). Alone, each is half the picture. Correlated, they
answer the question a responder actually has: *of everything the scan flagged, which ones
is an attacker acting on?*

Join key is the MITRE tactic both sides already carry (the mapping contract, §6.2): a
runtime alert tagged Privilege Escalation lines up with the scan findings tagged Privilege
Escalation. Confidence is tiered by how tightly the two sides actually match — because
"confirmed exploitation" is a strong claim it is reserved for a RESOURCE-level match:

  confirmed    — the runtime event names a pod that IS (or belongs to) the exact resource a
                 static finding is on, same namespace. This is the only tier that says
                 "this specific weakness is being acted on".
  corroborated — same tactic (and often same namespace) but no resource-level link. The
                 behaviour aligns with a known weakness class here, but we cannot prove it
                 is THIS finding — do not report it as exploited.
  runtime-only — a runtime alert with NO matching static finding (novel behaviour the scan
                 never predicted — often the most interesting).

A tactic+namespace coincidence is NOT proof of exploitation, so it is corroborated, never
confirmed.

Pure function of (findings, alerts): no cluster access, no scan re-run. Reuses the tactics
already on each Finding and RuntimeAlert.

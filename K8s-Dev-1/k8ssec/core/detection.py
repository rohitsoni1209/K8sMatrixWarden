"""
Detection Engine / Rule Executor (§6.1).

Executes the resolved rule set against the shared evidence snapshot, in parallel, with
per-rule isolation: a bug or exception in one rule becomes an INFO finding rather than
crashing the whole scan (this is the concrete answer to the Option-B "God module" critique
in the redesign doc — one bad check must not take the scan down).

External tool output (Trivy, kube-bench, kubescape, Falco) is folded in through the
`ExternalToolAdapter` interface, normalized to the same `Finding` schema (§22).
